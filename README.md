  <summary><h3>👨‍⚖️ Scott's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
    I started my coding journey in 1989 by taking an Introduction to Computers class at my local community college. I learned the basics of Pascal during this class, and found I had fallen in love with coding. 
    From there I started to work towards a degree in Computer Information Systems learning COBOL and C. Various things in life changed around this time and I had to give up pursuing my dream of programming. 30 years later     I would pick up where I left off during the height of the pandemic. I enrolled in my local community college and started to take classes in Web and Software Development. I have since completed my Assocaites Degree,
    and am looking to make a job change into full time programming. It has been a long journey getting to where I am today, but it reminds me our goals and a dreams are always within reach if we put in the effort to 
    achieve them.
